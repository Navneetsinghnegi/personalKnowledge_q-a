Healthy Eating Guide

Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for overall health and well-being. This guide covers the fundamentals of healthy eating and nutrition.

Macronutrients

The three main macronutrients are:

Carbohydrates: The body's primary energy source. Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables, and legumes over simple sugars. Recommended intake: 45-65% of daily calories.

Proteins: Essential for building and repairing tissues, making enzymes and hormones. Good sources include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, and nuts. Recommended intake: 10-35% of daily calories.

Fats: Necessary for hormone production, vitamin absorption, and cell health. Focus on healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish. Limit saturated fats and avoid trans fats. Recommended intake: 20-35% of daily calories.

Micronutrients

Vitamins and minerals are crucial for various bodily functions:

Vitamin D: Important for bone health and immune function. Sources include sunlight exposure, fatty fish, and fortified dairy products.

Vitamin C: Supports immune health and collagen production. Found in citrus fruits, berries, and bell peppers.

Iron: Essential for oxygen transport in blood. Sources include red meat, spinach, and fortified cereals.

Calcium: Critical for bone health. Found in dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified plant-based milks.

The Five Food Groups

A balanced diet includes foods from all five groups:

1. Fruits: Aim for 2-3 servings daily. Choose a variety of colors for different nutrients.

2. Vegetables: Target 3-5 servings daily. Include dark leafy greens, colorful vegetables, and starchy vegetables.

3. Grains: Make at least half your grains whole grains. Include brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat bread.

4. Protein: Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, nuts, and seeds.

5. Dairy: Choose low-fat or fat-free options. Alternatives include fortified soy, almond, or oat milk.
